Recently, the number of negative reviews has increased on Google Play, and as a consequence, the app's rating has been decreasing. The team has requested you to analyze the situation and make sense of the negative reviews.\n\nIt's up to you to apply K-means clustering from scikit-learn and NLP techniques through NLTK to sort text data from negative reviews in the Google Play Store into categories!\n\n## The Data\n\nA dataset has been shared with a sample of reviews and their respective scores (from 1 to 5) in the Google Play Store.
